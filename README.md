# Winc-Betsy-Webshop

This project is part of the back-end development course @winc.

The purpose of this project is to learn the ORM Peewee. I mainly focussed on Peewee, 
so it is possible that there are some lacks, however, the interaction with a database works perfectly:)

## Usage

To use this programm, use main.py tot execute the programm. It will fill a database from the testdata file.
Is will create the database with the model.py
